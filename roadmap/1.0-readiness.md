## Completed Items

| Item | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Version alignment | Done | CHANGELOG updated to 0.5.1, matches pyproject.toml |
| CI workflow | Done | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - runs lint + tests on Python 3.11/3.12 |
| API stability statement | Done | Added to README.md with stable API surface and compatibility guarantees |
| Support matrix | Done | Python 3.11/3.12, Ollama/LM Studio, all extras documented |
| Test coverage | Done | 44 tests passing, including RAG module tests |

## Deferred to Post-1.0

| Item | Reason | Tracking |
|------|--------|----------|
| `think` parameter support | Nice-to-have feature, not blocking | `roadmap/think-parameter-support.md` |

The `think` parameter for extended thinking models (DeepSeek R1, Qwen3) is well-specified but:
- Not required for core functionality
- Can be added in 1.1.0 as a non-breaking enhancement
- Currently tracked in feature request doc

Tested against consuming projects:
- **Ivan** - HashiCorp documentation assistant
- **milesoss** - Credit card rewards optimizer
